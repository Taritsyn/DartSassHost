   DESCRIPTION
   ===========
   .NET wrapper around the Dart Sass (https://github.com/sass/dart-sass) version
   1.70.0 with the ability to support a virtual file system.

   Since the original library is written in JavaScript, you will need a JS engine
   to run it. As a JS engine is used the JavaScript Engine Switcher library
   (https://github.com/Taritsyn/JavaScriptEngineSwitcher). For correct working, you
   need to install one of the following NuGet packages:

    * JavaScriptEngineSwitcher.ChakraCore
    * JavaScriptEngineSwitcher.Jint
    * JavaScriptEngineSwitcher.Msie (only in the Chakra “Edge” JsRT mode)
    * JavaScriptEngineSwitcher.V8

   After installing the packages, you will need to register the default JS engine
   (https://github.com/Taritsyn/JavaScriptEngineSwitcher/wiki/Registration-of-JS-engines).

   RELEASE NOTES
   =============
   1. Added support for the Dart Sass version 1.70.0;
   2. JS files are now bundled and minified by using the Google Closure Compiler to
      improve performance.
